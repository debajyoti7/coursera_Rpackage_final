# farsDebajyoti: Accident Data Analysis package by Debajyoti

This is an `R` package created for Coursera course [Building R Packages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-packages/home). 
It contains several basic functions for analyzing data from Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) - [source](http://www.nhtsa.gov/Data/Fatality-Analysis-Reporting-System-(FARS)). 

The objective here is to demonstrate the ability to document functions, create vignettes and write tests 
and provide test data with the package.
